Yes, you can use anything and everything on this site, as it is in the Public Domain.

In a nutshell, Public Domain works have no Copyright.
Works loose their Copyright, if
</center><ul>
<li>They were published in the U.S. before 1923</li>
<li>They were published with a copyright notice from 1923 through 1963 without copyright renewal</li>
<li>They were published without a copyright notice from 1923 through 1977</li>
<li>They were published without a copyright notice from 1978 through 1st of March 1989, and without subsequent registration within 5 years</li>
</ul><center>

Not everything, the banners on the <a href="http://comic.neocities.org/">index page</a> still have some Copyright. However, they were used because the creator of the work requested for them to be used around the web.
