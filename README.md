# comic.neocities.org
For some strange reason, in 2016 I thought that it was a good idea to make a new website dedicated to Public Domain comic books, I have no idea why I did this, but I just did. The URL for the site was [comic.neocities.org](https://comic.neocities.org/) - it's still online and I don't plan to take it down ever, but it's nice to know that I have mirrored it in some way.

Thinking about it, it's kind of funny that I would make something like this, as the website would not have been made today by me, as I just would have submitted the comics to The [Internet Archive](http://archive.org/), not bothered to write the layout for the site or anything else, and called it a day.

This is a full dump of the site - most of it is the same, but I did touch _some_ stuff up, so for example the only thing that I really did was run the whole site through [PNGGauntlet](https://pnggauntlet.com/) to save space with the image files, but apart from that one thing, that's all I changed.

I don't know if anyone at all will benefit from this site at all, for one the source is horrendous and all over the place, but I guess reading through some of the comics could be fun.
